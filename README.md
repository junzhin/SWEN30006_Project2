## Problem Context
Off the back of their overwhelming success with Snakes and Ladders on a Plane (sales went into double digits!), NERDI are back to work on their new game. While NERDI have learnt some lessons (sadly, none related to object oriented design), they still need the help of you and your team to assist them in getting their Oh Heaven card game market ready.
 
 
NERDI have a fully running version of the game, but the design is not very extendible or maintainable, it is limited in terms of configurability, and needs more NPC (Non-Playable Cardplayer) options.
